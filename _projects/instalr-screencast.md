  R is powerful data programming language and environment for statistical computing, data analysis and graphics. R is typically used to explore and understand data in an open-ended, highly interactive, iterative way. Learning R will give you the freedom to experiment and problem solve during data analysis — exactly what we need as bioinformaticians!

**NOTE**: 
Before getting our hands dirty working with real data in R, we need to learn the basics of the R language. Even if you’ve poked around in R and seen these concepts before, I would still recommend you follow along and complete the free online interactive learning tutorial [“TryR” (http://tryr.codeschool.com)](http://tryr.codeschool.com). This will take you through a gentle introduction to R syntax and some of the major R data structures (called vectors, matrices data.frames and lists) that we will cover in more detail in class .
