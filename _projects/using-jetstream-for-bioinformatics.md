## Notes:  
Jetstream is a cloud-based on-demand virtual machine system funded by the National Science Foundation. It will provide us with UNIX based computers (what we call “virtual machine instances”) that look and feel just like a regular Linux workstation but with thousands of times the computing power!

Here we cover configuring and connecting to Jetstream to supplement these detailed [step-by-step instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/jetstream/boot/).
