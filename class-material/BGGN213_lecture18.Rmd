# Pathway analysis from RNA-seq differential expression results

## Overview
Analysis of high-throughput biological data typically yields a list of genes or proteins requiring further interpretation - for example the ranked lists of differentially expressed genes we have been generating from our RNA-seq analysis to date. 

Our intention is typically to use such lists to gain novel insights about genes and proteins that may have roles in a given phenomenon, phenotype or disease progression. However, in many cases these 'raw' gene lists are challenging to interpret due to their large size and lack of useful annotations. Hence, our expensively assembled gene lists often fail to convey the full degree of possible insight about the condition being studied. 

Pathway analysis (also known as gene set analysis or over-representation analysis), aims to reduce the complexity of interpreting gene lists via mapping the listed genes to known (i.e. annotated) biological pathways, processes and functions. 

> **Side-note**: Pathway analysis can actually mean many different things to different people. This includes analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, protein–protein interaction networks, flux-balance analysis from kinetic simulations of pathways, etc. However, pathway analysis most commonly focuses on methods that exploit existing pathway knowledge (e.g. in public repositories such as GO or KEGG), rather than on methods that infer pathways from molecular measurements. These more general approaches are nicely reviewed in this paper:

### Patway analysis with R and Bioconductor
There are many freely available tools for pathway or over-representation analysis. As of Nov 2017 Bioconductor alone has over [80 packages categorized under gene set enrichment](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___GeneSetEnrichment) and over [120 packages categorized under pathways](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Pathways). 

Here we play with just one, the [**GAGE** package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/gage.html) (which stands for **G**enerally **A**pplicable **G**ene set **E**nrichment), to do KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on RNA-seq based differential expression results.

The [KEGG pathway database](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html), unlike GO for example, provides functional annotation as well as information about gene products that interact with each other in a given pathway, how they interact (e.g., activation, inhibition, etc.), and where they interact (e.g., cytoplasm, nucleus, etc.). Hence KEGG has the potential to provide extra insight beyond annotation lists of simple molecular function, process etc. from GO terms. 

In this analysis, we check for coordinated differential expression over gene sets from KEGG pathways instead of changes of individual genes. The assumption here is that consistent perturbations over a given pathway (gene set) may suggest mechanistic changes.


### About our Input Data

The data for for hands-on session comes from GEO entry: [GSE37704](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE37704), which is associated with the following publication: 

- Trapnell C, Hendrickson DG, Sauvageau M, Goff L et al. "*Differential analysis of gene regulation at transcript resolution with RNA-seq*". Nat Biotechnol 2013 Jan;31(1):46-53. [PMID: 23222703](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23222703)

The authors report on differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1. Their results and others indicate that HOXA1 is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. In particular their analysis show that "loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle". For our session we have used their [Sailfish](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2862) gene-level estimated counts and hence are restricted to protein-coding genes only. 

## Section 1. Differential Expression Analysis 

You can download the count data and associated metadata from here: [GSE37704_featurecounts.csv](https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_f17/class-material/GSE37704_featurecounts.csv) and [GSE37704_metadata.csv](https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_f17/class-material/GSE37704_metadata.csv). This is similar to our starting point for the last class where we used DESeq2 for the first time. We will use it again today!


```{r, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#library(dplyr)
library(DESeq2)
```

Load our data files

```{r}
metaFile <- "data/GSE37704_metadata.csv"
countFile <- "data/GSE37704_featurecounts.csv"

# Import metadata and take a peak
colData = read.csv(metaFile, row.names=1)
head(colData)


# Import countdata
countData = read.csv(countFile, row.names=1)
head(countData)
```

Hmm... remember that we need the `countData` and `colData` files to match up so we will need to remove that odd first column in `countData` namely `contData$length`.

```{r}
# Note we need to remove the odd first $length col
countData <- as.matrix(countData[,-1])
head(countData)
```

This looks better but there are lots of zero entries in there so let's get rid of them as we have no data for these.

```{r}
# Filter count data where you have 0 read count across all samples.
countData = countData[rowSums(countData)>1, ]
head(countData)
```


Nice now lets setup the DESeqDataSet object required for the **DESeq()** function and then run the DESeq pipeline. This is again similar to our last days hands-on session.

```{r}
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData,
                             colData=colData,
                             design=~condition)
dds = DESeq(dds)
dds
```

Next, get results for the HoxA1 knockdown versus control siRNA (remember we labeled these as "**hoxa1_kd**" and "**control_sirna**" in our original `colData` metaFile input to DESeq, you can check this above and by running `resultsNames(dds)` command). 

```{r}
res = results(dds, contrast=c("condition", "hoxa1_kd", "control_sirna"))
```

Let's reorder these results by p-value and call summary() on the results object to get a sense of how many genes are up or down-regulated at the default FDR of 0.1.

```{r}
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
summary(res)
```

Since we mapped and counted against the Ensembl annotation, our results only have information about Ensembl gene IDs. However, our pathway analysis downstream will use KEGG pathways, and genes in KEGG pathways are annotated with Entrez gene IDs. So lets add them as we did the last day. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")

columns(org.Hs.eg.db)

res$symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res), 
                    column="SYMBOL",
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    multiVals="first")

res$entrez = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res), 
                    column="ENTREZID",
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    multiVals="first")

res$name =   mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                    keys=row.names(res), 
                    column="GENENAME",
                    keytype="ENSEMBL",
                    multiVals="first")

head(res, 10)
```

Great, this is looking good so far. Now lets see how pathway analysis can help us make further sense out of this ranked list of differentially expressed genes.


## Section 2. Pathway Analysis
Here we are going to use the [**gage**]() package for pathway analysis. Once we have a list of enriched pathways, we're going to use the [**pathview**]() package to draw pathway diagrams, shading the molecules in the pathway by their degree of up/down-regulation.

### KEGG pathways

The **gageData** package has pre-compiled databases mapping genes to KEGG pathways and GO terms for common organisms. `kegg.sets.hs` is a named list of 229 elements. Each element is a character vector of member gene Entrez IDs for a single KEGG pathway. (See also `go.sets.hs`). The `sigmet.idx.hs` is an index of numbers of signaling and metabolic pathways in `kegg.set.gs`. In other words, KEGG pathway include other types of pathway definitions, like "Global Map" and "Human Diseases", which may be undesirable in pathway analysis. Therefore, `kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]` gives you the "cleaner" gene sets of signaling and metabolic pathways only.


> **Side-Note**: While there are many freely available tools to do pathway analysis, and some like gage are truly fantastic, many of them are poorly maintained or rarely updated. The DAVID tool that a lot of folks use for simple gene set enrichment analysis was not updated at all between Jan 2010 and Oct 2016.

First we need to do our one time install of these required bioconductor packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite( c("pathview", "gage", "gageData") )
```

Now we can load the packages and setup the KEGG data-sets we need.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(pathview)
library(gage)
library(gageData)

data(kegg.sets.hs)
data(sigmet.idx.hs)

kegg.sets.hs = kegg.sets.hs[sigmet.idx.hs]
head(kegg.sets.hs, 3)
```

The main **gage()** function requires a named vector of fold changes, where the names of the values are the Entrez gene IDs.

```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

Now, let’s run the pathway analysis. See help on the gage function with `?gage`. Specifically, you might want to try changing the value of `same.dir`. This value determines whether to test for changes in a gene set toward a single direction (all genes up or down regulated) or changes towards both directions simultaneously (i.e. any genes in the pathway dysregulated).

Here, we're using `same.dir=TRUE`, which will give us separate lists for pathways that are upregulated versus pathways that are down-regulated. Let’s look at the first few results from each.

```{r}
# Get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs, same.dir=TRUE)
```

Lets look at the result object. It is a list with three elements ("greater", "less" and "stats").

```{r}
attributes(keggres)
```

So it is a list object (you can check it with `str(keggres)`) and we can use the dollar syntax to access a named element, e.g.

```{r}
head(keggres$greater)
head(keggres$less)
```

Each `keggres$greater` and `keggres$less` object is data matrix with gene sets as rows sorted by p-value. Lets look at both up (greater), down (less), and statistics by calling **head()** with the **lapply()** function. As always if you want to find out more about a particular function or its return values use the R help system (e.g. `?gage` or `?lapply`).

```{r}
lapply(keggres, head)
```

Now, let's process the results to pull out the top 5 upregulated pathways, then further process that just to get the IDs. We’ll use these KEGG pathway IDs downstream for plotting.

```{r}
## Sanity check displaying all pathways data
pathways = data.frame(id=rownames(keggres$greater), keggres$greater)
head(pathways)

## focus on top 5 here only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

Finally, the **pathview()** function in the pathview package makes the plots. Let’s write a function so we can loop through and draw plots for the top 5 pathways we created above.

```{r, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Define plotting function for applying later
plot_pathway = function(pid) { 
  pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, 
           pathway.id=pid, 
           species="hsa", 
           new.signature=FALSE)
}

# plot multiple pathways (plots saved to disk and returns a throwaway list object)
tmp = sapply(keggresids, function(pid) pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=pid, species="hsa"))
```

Here are the plots:
![](hsa00140.pathview.png)


![](hsa04142.pathview.png)

![](hsa04630.pathview.png)

![](hsa04640.pathview.png)

![](hsa04740.pathview.png)



# Section 3. Gene Ontology (GO)
We can also do a similar procedure with gene ontology. Similar to above, go.sets.hs has all GO terms. go.subs.hs is a named list containing indexes for the BP, CC, and MF ontologies. Let’s only do Biological Process.

```{r}
data(go.sets.hs)
data(go.subs.hs)
gobpsets = go.sets.hs[go.subs.hs$BP]

gobpres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=gobpsets, same.dir=TRUE)

lapply(gobpres, head)
```


## Session Information
The `sessionInfo()` prints version information about R and any attached packages. It's a good practice to always run this command at the end of your R session and record it for the sake of reproducibility in the future.

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```
